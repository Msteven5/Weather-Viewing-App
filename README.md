This application was created to allow the user to sort through cities in America to check the weather forecast in a simple and easy to digest way. On the left, a city can be searched and then saved for easy access to the same city at a later time. The application will display the current weather at the top, and a 5-day forecast below.

Here is a screenshot of the layout of the application:
